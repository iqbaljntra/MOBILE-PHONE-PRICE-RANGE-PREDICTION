# Mobile Phone Price Range Prediction

This project aims to predict the price range of mobile phones based on various features such as specifications, brand, and other factors. By analyzing the data, the model can help users estimate the price range of a mobile phone before purchasing it.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model building and evaluation
- Price range prediction for mobile phones

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any other preferred IDE

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iqbaljntra/MOBILE-PHONE-PRICE-RANGE-PREDICTION.git
    cd MOBILE-PHONE-PRICE-RANGE-PREDICTION
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the notebook file `mobile_phone_price_prediction.ipynb` and run the cells to execute the code step-by-step.


## Data Description

The dataset contains various features related to mobile phones such as brand, specifications, and price range. Key features include:

- `battery_power`: Battery power in mAh
- `ram`: RAM capacity in GB
- `camera`: Megapixels of the primary camera
- `price_range`: Price range category (e.g., low, medium, high)

## Model Building

The model is built using the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, etc.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data distribution and relationships between features.
3. Model training: Using various algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, etc.
4. Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
